I have used papaparser package to access the data from the uploading csv file of any size.

Papa Parse is the fastest in-browser CSV (or delimited text) parser for JavaScript. It is reliable and correct according to RFC 4180, and it comes with these features:

Easy to use Parse CSV files directly (local or over the network) Fast mode (is really fast) Stream large files (even via HTTP) Reverse parsing (converts JSON to CSV) Auto-detect delimiter Worker threads to keep your web page reactive Header row support Pause, resume, abort Can convert numbers and booleans to their types Optional jQuery integration to get files from elements One of the only parsers that correctly handles line-breaks and quotations

Now the fastest JavaScript CSV parser for the browser. The world's first multi-threaded CSV parser for the browser. Papa can handle files gigabytes in size without crashing. Use Papa when performance, privacy, and correctness matter to us.
